// 
// Houston, we have a problem.
//
// During your first day at WizKidz Inc. you learn the software department is
// reeling from an automated refactor gone wrong performed by an AI it 
// has been developing.
//
// You are tasked with fixing the faulty programs.
//
// Problem:
// This program normally printed out "hello world" but now it just does not compile!
// In Go functions take typed arguments. 
//
// A commonly used type for printing out characters is the `string` type.
// A string in go is expressed by wrapping in double quotes `"`. i.e: "hey there!"
//
// Try fixing the argument to the fmt.Println function and run `go run hello.go`
// to see if it works.

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println(hello world)
}
