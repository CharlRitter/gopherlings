# gopherlings
üìòÔ∏è Learn Go by fixing tiny incorrect programs

This project was directly inspired by the great [ziglings](https://github.com/ratfactor/ziglings) project which itself was inspired by [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings).

For a first time learner it is suggested you complement this material with another source such as

- [Go by example](https://gobyexample.com/). A lot of material here is based on this project!
- [Go go-to guide](https://yourbasic.org/golang/) by yourbasic. Great source for beginners.

## Intended Audience
These exercises will probably be difficult if you've never programmed before. 

The exercises should be self-contained and self-explained, though this is a WIP
and suggestions are welcome!

## Instructions: Running exercises
Requires a [Go installation](https://go.dev/dl/) to run the examples.
